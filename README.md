# Weather-Forecast - Spring Boot Web Reactive with Cloud-Starter-Zipkin and Java 12

Simple weather forecast SpringBoot app using openweathermap API

# Prerequisite

1. Docker
2. Java 12
3. Gradle
4. Create a free account at [https://home.openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/) (otherwise a failover will generate random values)

# 1 - Start Zipkin
```console
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```
# 2 - Update the property file with your open-weather appId

# 3 - Start to service
```console
cd weather-forecast
./gradlew bootRun
```
# 4 - Send some requests
The API is simplistic: http://localhost:8080/{country_code}/{city}
```console
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/uk/london
```

# 5 - Analyse the data in Zipkin
Open your favorite browser and go to [http://localhost:9411/zipkin](http://localhost:9411/zipkin) to see the data generated by your request.

# To come:
- Extraction of the Failover service in a separate micro-service
- Docker file for the service
- Docker-Compose orchestration
- Kubernetes Orchestration
