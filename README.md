# Weather-Forecast - Spring Boot Web Reactive with Cloud-Starter-Zipkin and Java 12

Simple weather forecast SpringBoot app using openweathermap API
- Zipkin server
- SpringBoot service using Java 12 for Weather Forecast using a random forecast generator if Open Weather API is not configured correctly
- Docker-Compose Orchestration

# Prerequisite

1. Docker-compose
2. Create a free account at [https://home.openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/) (otherwise a failover will generate random values)

# 1 - Update your open-weather appId
Either
- resources/application.properties
- docker-compose.yml
- environment variable ${OPENWEATHER_APPID}

# 2 - Start to service
```console
cd weather-forecast
docker-compose up -d
```
# 3 - Send some requests
The API is simplistic: http://localhost:8080/{country_code}/{city}
```console
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/uk/london
```

# 4 - Analyse the data in Zipkin
Open your favorite browser and go to [http://localhost:9411/zipkin](http://localhost:9411/zipkin) to see the data generated by your request.

# To come:
- Extraction of the Failover service in a separate micro-service
- Kubernetes Orchestration
